This is a repository for the homework solutions of Stat 579
(Introduction to Statistical Computing) at Iowa State University. LyX
and pgfSweave are used to write solutions, and only the source files
are kept in this repository; PDF files are uploaded separately so you
can download directly when clicking the `Downloads' button in the
top-right corner.
